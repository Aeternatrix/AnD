# Just a place of practice
Since deleting the public repositories I did have an age ago—it looks a bit bare here. So, I have decided to make this repository.

It has been an age and a half since I half learnt about Alogrithms and Data Structures. At the time, I was annoyed that I had to do it in Python; and thus really didn't put any effort into learning 'Pythonic' things... such as how to import the already made data structures from whatever library they were in. Just to avoid that little bit of effort, I had made my own implementations of the structures; which, other than the python-ness of it all, I definitely found more fun.

In so doing, I think I focused more on the data structure side of the class and much less on the algorithm side. Now, more than a few years later of not practicing/internalising algorithm things™, I believe I have trouble remembering how to do them. Thus I have decided to do something about that and go look for some algorithms and data structures to make (probably terrible) implementations of.

I have long since lost whatever resources I had for the Algorithms and Data Structures class I took; luckily, there's online resources easily accessible to give me starting points. To which I will credit as I implement (below); if there's something uncredited, it's because the description of it was from memory.

For now, I only plan to do implementations in C/C++, maybe C# and/or Java if I'm feeling 'high-level'. I tried Assembly the other day for the first time since a 30 minute last-class-of-the-semester practical in Embeded Systems and enjoyed it more than I remembered. So, add Assembly if I'm feeling particularly *spicy*.
